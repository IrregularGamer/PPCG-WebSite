        <h2>3. Payments and Refunds</h2>
        <h3>a. Payment Terms</h3>
        <p>
          Clients must pay 30% of the package price upfront. The remaining 70%
          is payable upon project completion and satisfaction.

          The 30% upfront payment is non-refundable. The 70% balance is payable

          factors beyond our control (e.g., market trends, regulatory changes)
          affecting the outcome of the project are not grounds for withholding
          payment.

          By agreeing to these terms, you acknowledge that we invest significant
          time and resources into our services and that results are influenced

          depend on factors beyond our control.
